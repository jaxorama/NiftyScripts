Simple useful scripts that I often use

PDF2Word.py
===========
python.exe PDF2Word.py C:\PDFs
This converts all the PDF files in the C:\PDFs folder to docx Word documents. 

WordleSolver.py
===============
python.exe WordleSolver.py
This uses the word-list.txt file. You can enter the guess and Wordle's response as GGBBY. (Green, Black, Yellow)
When all the letters show GGGGG, you have cracked the game.

SpellingBee.py
==============
python.exe words_alpha.txt abcdefg a
Provide the word list as first parameter, all the letters as second parameter and central letter as third parameter.
The script will generate several options. Also list all the possible pangrams in the end.
