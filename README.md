Simple useful scripts that I often use

PDF2Word.py
===========
python.exe PDF2Word.py C:\PDFs
This converts all the PDF files in the C:\PDFs folder to docx Word documents. 

WordleSolver.py
===============
python.exe WordleSolver.py
This uses the word-list.txt file. You can enter the guess and Wordle's response as GGBBY. (Green, Black, Yellow)
When all the letters show GGGGG, you have cracked the game.
